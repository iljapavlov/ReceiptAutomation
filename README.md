# ReceiptAutomation

# Development Plan: Receipt Analyzer Application
## Stage 1: Setting up email access and downloading receipts
Key steps:
1. Set up a secure method to access the user's email inbox
2. Implement email filtering to identify messages containing receipts
3. Download and save relevant emails

Technologies:
1. Python
2. IMAP library (e.g., imaplib)
3. Email parsing library (e.g., email)
4. Secure credential storage (e.g., environment variables, AWS Secrets Manager)

## Stage 2: Processing emails and parsing receipts
Key steps:
1. Implement parsers for different email formats (HTML, plain text, PDF)
2. Extract relevant purchase data (items, prices, quantities, store info)
3. Implement OCR for PDF receipts if necessary
4. Standardize extracted data format

## Stage 3: Storing purchase data in a database
Key steps:
1. Design database schema for storing purchase data and nutritional information
2. Set up a database server
3. Implement database operations (insert, update, query)
4. Create data models and ORM mappings

## Stage 4: Developing the web interface
Key steps:
1. Design and implement RESTful API endpoints
2. Create React components for displaying statistics and nutritional information
3. Implement data visualization for expense trends and nutritional breakdowns
4. Design and implement user authentication and authorization


## Stage 5: Implementing automation and notifications
Key steps:
1. Set up a task scheduler for regular email checking and processing
2. Implement a notification system for new receipts and important statistics
3. Create email or push notification functionality
4. Develop user preference settings for automation and notifications


Testing and Deployment
Testing:

Implement unit tests for each component (email parsing, data extraction, API endpoints)
Create integration tests for the entire pipeline
Perform user acceptance testing

Deployment:

Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
Containerize the application using Docker
Deploy to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean)
Set up monitoring and logging (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack)
